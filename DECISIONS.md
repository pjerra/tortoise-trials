# Decisions

Short, dated notes on choices that are not obvious from the code.

## 2026-11-08: explicit `level_delta: 0` is 0 (was +1)

`mobs.level_delta` is read by `trl/live/ladder.base_delta` (the live situation and the difficulty ladder
both start from it). It used `int(x or 1)`, so a written 0 ran one level harder than written. Now only an
absent (or null) value defaults to +1; an explicit 0 is 0 and the ladder steps down from 0.

The FOLLOWUPS note counted 7 trial files that write 0. Four are live trial files; the other three were
`.bak` copies in the old working copy. Per file:

| file | kind | mobs.count | decision |
|---|---|---|---|
| `trials/healers/paladin-blessing-ooc.json` | ooc_buffs | 0 | 0 was meant: no mob is summoned, so the value is a placeholder (validation wants an int). Kept as 0; no behaviour change. |
| `trials/healers/priest-holy-fort-ooc.json` | ooc_buffs | 0 | same |
| `trials/healers/priest-holy-pws-battle-ooc-control.json` | ooc_hurt | 0 | same |
| `trials/healers/priest-holy-pws-def-arms-ooc.json` | ooc_hurt | 0 | same |

None of the four reaches `level_window` (no summon, no mobs-ready check, the ladder is off for these kinds),
so the change alters no existing trial. No trial file was changed. Every other trial writes 1, -2 or leaves
the value as the validator-required int.
